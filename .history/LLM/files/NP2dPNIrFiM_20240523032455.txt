**Summary:**

This video introduces the concepts of web server and client-server architecture in backend development. It highlights the choice of JavaScript as the programming language and discusses the options of node.js and bun as runtime environments. The core concepts of HTTP, such as requests, responses, and status codes, are explained.

**Key Points:**

* **Web Server Architecture:** A client makes a request to a web server, which then interacts with a database.
* **JavaScript as the Programming Language:** JavaScript is a popular choice for backend development, and both node.js and bun provide runtime environments for it.
* **HTTP Basics:** HTTP requests include URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), and body (data). Responses include status code, headers, and body (content).
* **node.js Web Server:** Using node, a web server can be created by importing the HTTP module and creating a server instance. The server listens on a specific host and port, and responds to requests.
* **bun Web Server:** bun simplifies the process of creating a web server. The `serve()` method takes care of listening on a port and handling requests.
* **Code Walkthrough:** Example code is provided for both node.js and bun web servers, which respond to different URLs with different messages.
* **Helper Frameworks:** To improve developer experience, frameworks like Express provide error handling, routing, and other features.
